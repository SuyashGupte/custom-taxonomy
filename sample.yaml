Mustafizur to Miller, SIX, a shot of supreme quality! Full on off-stump, just a shade overpitched and this was just a check-drive from Miller, was struck on the up and he timed it so sweetly, went high and far over long-off, such a difficult shot on this deck because he had to trust the pace

Rabada to Tanzid Hasan, out Caught by de Kock!! Edged & taken!! A length ball from Rabada, angling outside off and Tanzid slashed at it. Gets an edge through to the keeper. A tepid appeal from Rabada and no real appeal from keeper or slips. Was surprising since there was a clear sound as the ball passed the bat.
